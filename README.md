## About/Purpose ❔
---

The purpose of this webpage/app is do provide you a means for planning out your work day.  The page is color coded based on whether the time blocks are in the future, current or past. The data is saved to local storage which allows your notes to stay persistent.  The app will check the time every second and update the colors as needed without requiring you to refresh the page.


## Takeaways 🥡
--- 
* Learned how to use Javascript to fully and dynamically create elements on the page
* Learned how to use Luxon API for time
* Gained more confidence with JQUERY
